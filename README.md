Tut in CommonMark Website
====

This project, the "Tut in CommonMark" website (get it?! Tut-in-CommonMark?  
Tutankhamen-Mark? Nerd humor!) is created in response to a blog post on
[CodingHorror.com](http://blog.codinghorror.com/toward-a-better-markdown-tutorial/).
 
The purpose of the website is to provide a highly interactive, approachable tutorial
for learning Markdown (specifically, the CommonMark variety).  The current implementation
is very basic, providing nothing more than a text area to insert markdown and another area
to view the resulting formatted text.

Future plans include interactive tutorials and quick references for common and advanced usages.
